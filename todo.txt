- prettier error output
  - make TypeError -> Spanned<TypeErrorVariant>
  - make Value -> Spanned<ValueVariant>
  - put type names into the AST, keep them out of the mir

- actually modularize mir, don't just put it in multiple files

- checking to see if a number is in range

- parens
- non-addition operators
- reference functions parameters

- unary operators (+)

- good typechecking
