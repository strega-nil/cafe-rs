notes:
  - `-` means "something that will happen at some point"
  - `*` means "something that will happen soon"

- USER EXPERIENCE
  - prettier error output
  * types not found should point to the type, not to the thing around it

- COMPILER DESIGN
  - do more to modularize mir
  - modularize ast
  - string cache

- COMPILED CODE ISSUES
  - checking to see if a number is in range

- LANGUAGE
  * reference function parameters
  * fully flesh out the basic types
  * user defined types!
  - parens
  - non-addition operators
  - non-decimal integer literals
  - early return

  - unary operators (+)

  - good typechecking
